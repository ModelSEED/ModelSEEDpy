CommunityModel()
+++++++++++++++++++++

The species in a community model are parsed based upon the composition of the model biomass reaction:

.. code-block:: python

 from modelseedpy.core.mscommunity import CommunityModelSpecies
 com_species = CommunityModelSpecies(community, biocpd, names)

- *community* ``cobra.core.model.Model``: the CobraKBase community model that will be simulated. The conversion from `standard COBRA models  <https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/cobra/core/model/index.html>`_ to CobraKBase models is facilitated by the `cobrakbase` package. 
- *biocpd* ``cobrakbase.core.kbasefba.fbamodel_metabolite.ModelCompound``: the biomass metabolite that will be investigated in relation to the simulated community model.
- *names* ``list``: the list of species in the community model, which are indexed sequentially according to their community number.

----------------------
disable_species()
----------------------

A species can be practically muted from a community simulation by constraining all reaction fluxes of that species to be zero:

.. code-block:: python

 com_species.disable_species()

The code applies to the species and community that are loaded and parsed in the ``CommunityModel`` class.

-----------------------------
compute_max_biomass()
-----------------------------

The biomass production of the community model is determined when a reaction, in which the parameterized biomass metabolite is produced, is optimized.

.. code-block:: python

 com_species.compute_max_biomass()

The code applies to the species, community, and metabolite that are loaded and parsed in the ``CommunityModel`` class.

**returns** the optimization result

----------------------
compute_max_atp()
----------------------

The biomass production of the community model is determined when the ATP hydrolysis reaction, which is added to the model when it is not present, is optimized.

.. code-block:: python

 com_species.compute_max_atp()

The code applies to the species and community that are loaded and parsed in the ``CommunityModel`` class.

**returns** the optimization result

----------------------
Accessible content

Several objects within the ``FullThermo`` class may be useful for subsequent post-processing or troubleshooting of the simulation results:

- *model* ``cobra.core.model.Model``: the cobrakbase model, with the corresponding constraints, that is simulated.
- *species_num* ``int``: the number that is assigned to the species under consideration in the community model.
- *species_id*  ``str``: the identification of the species under consideration in the community model.
- *abundance* ``int``: the abundance of the species under consideration in the community model.
- *biomasses* ``list``: the collection of community reactions, excluding transport reactions, that produce the investigated metabolite.
- *biomass_drain* ``cobra.core.model.Reaction``: the transport reaction that drains the investigated metabolite into the extracellular environment.
