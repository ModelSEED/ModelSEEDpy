FullThermoPkg()

This class applies and simulates rigorous thermodynamic constraints upon COBRA models:

.. code-block:: python

 from modelseedpy.fbapkg import FullThermoPkg
 tfa = FullThermoPkg(model)

- *model* ``cobra.core.model.Model``: the CobraKBase model that will be simulated. The conversion from `standard COBRA models  <https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/cobra/core/model/index.html>`_ to CobraKBase models is facilitated by the `cobrakbase` package. 
           
----------------------
build_package()
----------------------

A cobrakbase model is simulated with the parameterized kinetics data over the defined time and conditions:

.. code-block:: python

 tfa.build_package(parameters, verbose = True)

- *parameters* ``dict``: specifies simulations parameters in base metric units -- e.g. Molar, Kilojoules per mol, and Kelvins -- that are used to populate the FBA simulation. The default concentrations,

and compartment potentials (the extracellular environment is 0 by definition to facilitate community modeling),

            "e0":0,     
            "c0":-160   
 }

are supplanted by specified parameters

.. code-block:: json

 {               
            "default_max_conc":0.02,    
            "default_min_conc":0.000001,

            "dgbin":false
 }

that can be adjusted through the ``parameters`` argument. The only required key in ``parameters`` that must be provided by the user is the ``modelseed_db_path`` that enables the import of the ModelSEED Database. 

- *verbose* ``bool``: specifies whether simulation details and calculations will be printed, which is valuable for troubleshooting.

Accessible content
----------------------

Several objects within the ``FullThermo`` class may be useful for subsequent post-processing or troubleshooting of the simulation results:

- *model* ``cobra.core.model.Model``: The cobrakbase model, with the corresponding constraints, that is simulated.
- *variables* & *parameters* ``dict``: Dictionaries of the linear programming variables and the simulation parameters.
- *pkgmgr* ``modelseedpy.fbapkg.mspackagemanager.MSPackageManager``: The collection of associated classes that are used in the FullThermo package.
